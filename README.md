# Telecom Churn Case Study

## Business Understanding

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. In this project, we will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

## Objective
Goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.
